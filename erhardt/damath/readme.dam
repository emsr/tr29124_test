The DAMath archive contains units for double precision accurate mathematical
methods without using multi precision arithmetic or assembler. The main
purpose is to make the AMath functions available for 64-bit systems without
Extended Precision or 387-FPU, but they can be used with 32-bit systems.

The source can be compiled with the usual Pascal versions that allow const
parameters (tested with BP 7.0, VP 2.1, FPC 1.0/2.0/2.2/2.4/2.6/3x, and
Delphi versions 1-7/9-10/12/17-18).

The units assume IEEE-754 53-bit double precision (binary64) and rounding to
nearest; there are NO rounding / precision control functions.

DAMath V0.83: This unit implements the double precision accurate elementary
mathematical functions: exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, hyperbolic,
inverse circular / hyperbolic functions; and there are the polynomial,
vector, statistic operations and floating point functions. The file
damath_info.txt contains the complete list of DAMath functions with short
descriptions.

DAMath uses the system functions abs, arctan, frac, int, ln, and trunc
(including possible bugs for 32-bit). Because FPC-64 (version <= 2.6.4)
looses up to 13 of the 53 bits for exp, DAMath implements its own exp
function. System sin(x) and cos(x) are used for |x| <= Pi/4, Payne/Hanek
range reduction is performed if |x| > 2^30.

On Win7/64 the 64-bit DAMath's one argument elementary transcendental
functions (except cosd, sind, ..) and power have peak relative errors
< 2*eps_d (about 4.4E-16), the RMS values are < 0.6*eps_d, a complete list
and the Delphi/FPC figures can be found in the log file t_xdamat64.cmp.

The dbl2 (double-double) routines operate on pairs of 53-bit double
floating point numbers, which represent the unevaluated sum of the high and
low parts: a = (a.h, a.l) = a.h + a.l, normally with |a.l| < eps_d*|a.h|.

The DAMTools V0.33 unit provides accurate and reliable tools for finding
zeroes and local minima of functions, numerical integration of one-dimensional
functions,convergence acceleration of sums and sequences, and solving
quadratic or cubic equations:

The functions localmin, mbrent, and fmin (differing in parameter count/ease
of use) use Brent's algorithm with guaranteed convergence for finding a
local minimum of a function f in an interval (a,b). The algorithm combines
golden section search and successive parabolic interpolation using only
function (not derivative) evaluations. The functions zbrent and zeroin use
the Brent/Dekker algorithm with guaranteed convergence for finding a zero of
a continuous function f in the interval [a,b], when f(a) and f(b) have
different signs. The algorithm is based on a combination of successive
interpolations and bisection.

The qag* procedures are Pascal translations of Quadpack algorithms by R.
Piessens, E. de Doncker-Kapenga, C.W. Ueberhuber, D. Kahaner. These routines
perform global adaptive quadrature of functions over finite or infinite
intervals based on Gauss-Kronrod rules for the subintervals and acceleration
by Wynn's epsilon algorithm, they can handle rather difficult integrals
including integrand functions with local difficulties such as a disconti-
nuities and integrable singularities. quagk is a simple general purpose
shell for the qag* routines. The Quadpack algorithm qawc computes the Cauchy
principal value of f(x)/(x-c) using a globally adaptive strategy and
modified Clenshaw-Curtis integration on the subintervals containing the
point x=c.

The procedures intdeo and intdei use the Double Exponential (DE) trans-
formation (developed by M. Mori, T. Ooura, and others) for automatic
quadrature of f(x) over the infinite interval (a,+INF) for functions with
and without oscillatory factors resp. The DE transformation is very powerful
if the abscissas a+xi can be processed with high accuracy; therefore the
two routines are best used with a=0, otherwise there can be severe roundoff
problems (a+xi=a).

The adaptive quanc8 algorithm by G.E. Forsythe, M.A. Malcolm, C.B. Moler
estimates the integral of a smooth function over a finite interval using a
Newton-Cotes rule.

The procedures levinu1 and wynneps1 are stand-alone versions of convergence
acceleration methods, they perform one step of the Levin u-transformation for
sums or one step of Wynn's epsilon algorithm for the sequences or sums
(original customized versions are used in LerchPhi and the Quadpack routines,
respectively). The calling driver routines have analyze the convergence of
the processes.

The squad functions accurately solve quadratic equations with double
coefficients; they implement ideas of G.E. Forsythe, W. Kahan, P.H. Sterbenz
(high precision calculation of discriminant, scaling by powers of two etc).
The cubsolve procedure computes the solutions of real cubic equations with
double coefficients; it is based on lecture notes by W. Kahan.

The unit SpecFunD V1.21.02 implements many special functions for double and
extended precision. The DAMath based double precision special functions are
derived from the AMath implementations (i.e. the descriptions in the AMath
introduction and the specialfunctions.pdf manual are essentially valid), the
interfaced functions have the same names, etc.

In this release the following function groups are available:

 * Bessel functions and related
 * Elliptic integrals, elliptic / theta functions
 * Error function and related
 * Exponential integrals and related
 * Gamma function and related
 * Orthogonal polynomials, Legendre functions, and related
 * Hypergeometric functions and related
 * Statistical distributions
 * Zeta functions, polylogarithms, and related
 * Other special functions

The relative errors of the DAMath special functions are usually larger
(especially on 64-bit systems) than those of the corresponding AMath double
functions (which are often correctly rounded due to the internal extended
precision calculations).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The unit DAMCmplx V0.45 provides DAMath based complex arithmetic, basic and
transcendental functions. The complex data type is a record with real and
imaginary parts of type double. Most routines are procedures with const input
record(s) and a var output record.

Please note that the exponential, trigonometric, or hyperbolic functions
may overflow or return INFs or NaNs for inputs with real or imaginary parts
of order ln_MaxDbl or greater, this will be handled more systematically in
future versions.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last changes (Oct. 2015):

* New lemniscate functions sin lemn and cos lemn,

* the reflection formula for polygamma uses derivatives of Euler's
  series for Pi*cot(Pi*x),

* the parabolic cylinder function V(a,x) is extended to negative a.
