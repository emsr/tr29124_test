I. INTRODUCTION

     As stated in the preface of our book "Computation of Special 
Functions,"  the purpose of this book is to share with the reader  
a set of computer programs (130 in total) which we have developed 
during the past several years for computing a variety of  special  
mathematical functions.  For your convenience, we attach to the
book this diskette that contains all the computer programs  
listed or mentioned in the book. 

     In this diskette,  we place all the programs under directory 
SMF\PROGRAMS. In order to illustrate the use of these programs 
and facilitate your testing of the programs, we wrote a short 
simple main program for each program so that you can readily test 
them.    

     All the programs are written in FORTRAN-77 and tested on PCs
and workstations. Therefore, they should run on any computer with 
implementation of the FORTRAN-77 standard.  

     Although we have made a great effort to test these programs,  
we would not be surprised  to find some errors in them.  We would 
appreciate it if you can bring to our attention any errors you find.
You can do this by either writing us directly at the location
(e-mail: j-jin1@uiuc.edu) or writing to the publisher, whose address 
appears on the back cover of the book.  However, we must note that
all these programs are sold "as is," and we cannot guarantee to 
correct the errors reported by readers on any fixed schedule.

     All the programs and subroutines  contained in this diskette 
are copyrighted.   However,  we give permission to the reader who
purchases this book to incorporate any of these programs into his
or her programs provided that the copyright is acknowledged. 

     Regarding the specifics of the programs, we want to make the
following two points.

  1) All the programs are written in double precision.   Although
     the use of double precision is  necessary for some programs,
     especially for those based on series expansions,  it is not 
     necessary for all programs.  For example, the computation of
     of special functions based on polynomial approximations does
     not have to use double precision.  We chose to write all the
     programs using double precision in order to  avoid  possible 
     confusion  which  may  occur in using  these  programs.  If 
     necessary,  you can  convert  the programs into the single
     precision format easily.  However,  doing so for some 
     programs may lead to a lower accuracy.

  2) In the main programs that calculate a  sequence  of  special 
     functions, we usually set the maximum order or degree to 100
     or 250.  However, this is not a limit.  To compute functions  
     with a higher order or degree, all you need to do is simply 
     set the dimension of proper arrays higher.  


II. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

     Although we have made a great effort to test and validate the 
computer programs, we make no warranties, express or implied, that 
these  programs  are  free  of  error,  or are consistent with any 
particular  standard  of  merchantability,  or that they will meet 
your requirements for any particular application.  They should not 
be relied on for  solving problems  whose incorrect solution could 
result in  injury to  a person or loss of property.  If you do use 
the programs in such a manner, it is at your own risk. The authors 
and publisher  disclaim all liability for  direct or consequential 
damages resulting from your use of the programs.
