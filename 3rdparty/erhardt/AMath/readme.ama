The AMath archive contains units for accurate mathematical methods without
using multi precision arithmetic. Please note that the high accuracy can only
be achieved with the rmNearest rounding mode; it decreases if other modes are
used. AMath is designed for the 80-bit extended data type, and therefore
cannot be used with 64-bit code on 64-bit system (for these use the
corresponding DAMath package).

The units and basic test programs can be compiled with Pascal (BP7, VP 2.1,
FPC 1.0/2.0-2.6/3x) and Delphi (2-7/9-10/12/17-18/25/26) versions. The test
suites run without 'failure warnings about relative errors' on Intel CPUs on
Win98, Win2000 (see log files), WinXP, and Win7. There may be some sporadic
warnings with other processors or operating systems; normally, these are NOT
AMath bugs but features of the CPU (and can be avoided by using slightly
increased error levels).

AMath V2.50: This unit implements accurate mathematical functions; it makes
many routines of Delphi's math unit available to other supported Pascal
versions and fixes bugs and inaccuracies of Delphi:

It is known since more than 15 years that exp looses up to 13 bits for
extended arguments; even the newer Delphi versions (confirmed up to D14,
some are corrected in D17+) have horrible bugs: e.g. arccsch(2) =
0.27980789397 (correct = 0.48121182506); coth(12000)=1 crashes;
sech(12000)=0 crashes; sinh(x)/x=0 for small x; sin(1e22)=1e22 (correct =
-0.852200849767); StdDev(a,a+1,a+2) crashes e.g. for a=100000000000; etc..

AMath's elementary mathematical functions include: exponential, logarithmic,
trigonometric, hyperbolic, inverse circular / hyperbolic functions. There
are polynomial, vector, statistic operations as well as floating point and
FPU control functions. Delphi's nonsense routines (IfThen, IsZero, InRange
...) and its financial functions are not (and will not be) implemented. The
file amath_info.txt contains the complete list of AMath functions with short
descriptions.

All standard one argument elementary transcendental functions have peak
relative errors less than 2.2e-19, values for power(x,y) are 2.1e-19 (for
|x|,|y| < 1000) and 3.4e-19 (for |x|,|y| < 2000). The precision is tested
with the t_amathx program using MPArith functions.

The ext2 (double-extended) routines operate on pairs of extended floating
point numbers, which represent the unevaluated sum of the high and low parts:
a = (a.h, a.l) = a.h + a.l, normally with |a.l| <= eps_x*|a.h|.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The AMTools V0.46 unit provides accurate and reliable tools for finding zeros
and local minima of functions, numerical integration of one-dimensional
functions,convergence acceleration of sums and sequences, and solving
quadratic /cubic / polynomial equations:

The functions localmin, mbrent, and fmin (differing in parameter count/ease of
use) use Brent's algorithm with guaranteed convergence for finding a local
minimum of a function f in an interval (a,b). The algorithm combines golden
section search and successive parabolic interpolation using only function (not
derivative) evaluations. The functions zbrent and zeroin use the Brent/Dekker
algorithm with guaranteed convergence for finding a zero of a continuous
function f in the interval [a,b], when f(a) and f(b) have different signs;
zbrenty handles the zeros of f(x)-y. The algorithm is based on a combination
of successive interpolations and bisection. zridders implements Ridders' root
finding method based on regula falsi and exponential factors.

The qag* procedures are Pascal translations of Quadpack algorithms by R.
Piessens, E. de Doncker-Kapenga, C.W. Ueberhuber, D. Kahaner. These routines
perform global adaptive quadrature of functions over finite or infinite
intervals based on Gauss-Kronrod rules for the subintervals and acceleration
by Wynn's epsilon algorithm, they can handle rather difficult integrals
including integrand functions with local difficulties such as a disconti-
nuities and integrable singularities. quagk is a simple general purpose
shell for the qag* routines. The Quadpack algorithm qawc computes the Cauchy
principal value of f(x)/(x-c) using a globally adaptive strategy and
modified Clenshaw-Curtis integration on the subintervals containing the
point x=c.

The procedures intdeo and intdei use the Double Exponential (DE) trans-
formation (developed by M. Mori, T. Ooura, and others) for automatic
quadrature of f(x) over the infinite interval (a,+INF) for functions with
and without oscillatory factors resp. intde integrates over finite
intervals (a,b) and intde_p, intdei_p are the corresponding procudures for
functions f(x,p) with parameters.

The adaptive quanc8 algorithm by G.E. Forsythe, M.A. Malcolm, C.B. Moler
estimates the integral of a smooth function over a finite interval using a
Newton-Cotes rule.

The procedures levinu1 and wynneps1 are stand-alone versions of convergence
acceleration methods, they perform one step of the Levin u-transformation for
sums or one step of Wynn's epsilon algorithm for the sequences or sums
(original customized versions are used in LerchPhi and the Quadpack routines,
respectively). The calling driver routines have analyze the convergence of
the processes.

The squad functions accurately solve quadratic equations with double
coefficients; they implement ideas of G.E. Forsythe, W. Kahan, P.H. Sterbenz
(high precision calculation of discriminant, scaling by powers of two etc).
The cubsolve procedure computes the solutions of real cubic equations with
double coefficients; it is based on lecture notes by W. Kahan. The PolyRoots
procedures compute the n (complex) roots x[k] + i*y[k] of the polynomial
p(z) = p[0] + p[1]*z + ... p[n]*z^n   using a companion matrix method,
balancing, and the QR algorithm for the eigenvalues of an upper Hessenberg
matrix.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The units SpecFun/SpecFunX V1.53.03 implement many special functions for
double and extended precision. In this release the following function
groups are available:

 * Bessel functions and related,
 * elliptic integrals/functions and theta functions,
 * gamma function and related,
 * zeta functions, polylogarithms, and related,
 * error function and related,
 * exponential integrals and related,
 * orthogonal polynomials, Legendre functions and related,
 * hypergeometric functions and related,
 * statistical distributions,
 * and other special functions.

Currently all functions have double and extended versions (with name suffix
x), eg. erfc vs. erfcx, amath_info.txt contains the complete list of AMath
special functions with short descriptions. The file specialfunctions.pdf (on
the web site) contains the reference manual with implementation notes for
the special functions.

Generally the extended versions have larger relative errors (measured in
corresponding machine epsilon units eps_x or eps_d) than their double
counterparts, especially gammax and betax for large arguments. Note that
some functions are sensitive to small changes in the argument; therefore in
high precision comparisons argument values should be used, that are
representable in both calculations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The unit AMCmplx V1.14 provides AMath based complex arithmetic, basic and
transcendental functions. The complex data type is a record with real and
imaginary parts of type extended. Most routines are procedures with const
input record(s) and a var output record; therefore the units are usable with
BP7 or newer.

Please note that the exponential, trigonometric, or hyperbolic functions
may overflow or return INFs or NaNs for inputs with real or imaginary parts
of order ln_MaxExt or greater, this will be handled more systematically in
future versions.

The internal archive complexdemo.zip contains the expression parser /
interpreter amccalc.pas and the accompanying demo programs PlotPhase (a GUI
application for the visualization of complex functions, on the right a sample
image) and T_CCalcX (a console program for the evaluation of complex
expressions).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The unit AMQuat V0.20 units provide AMath based quaternionic arithmetic and
elementary transcendental functions here is the complete list with short
descriptions. The quaternion data type is a record with real (or scalar)
and imaginary (or vector) parts using the base type extended.

  type
    Quaternion = record
                   r:     extended; {real or scalar part     }
                   x,y,z: extended; {imaginary or vector part}
                 end;

Most routines are procedures with const input record(s) and a var output
record. A quaternion is often written as a = r*1 + x*i + y*j + z*k, where 1,
i, j, k are the fundamental quaternion units (as 4-dimensional vectors they
are the standard unit vectors).

Addition and subtraction are defined component-wise, i.e. the standard
vector addition in R4. Multiplication of quaternions is associative and
distributive, but it is not commutative, it is determined by the relations
i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. The norm of a quaternion is r^2 + x^2 + y^2 +z^,
the absolute value |a| is the square root of the norm, and conj(a) = r*1 -
x*i - y*j - z*k is the conjugate. The multiplicative inverse is (1/a) =
conj(a)/norm(a), division is defined as a/b = a*(1/b).

Most (inverse) trigonometric / hyperbolic quaternion functions b=f(a) are
basically computed with the corresponding complex function w=F(z) with z =
Re(a) + i*abs(Im(a)) and the mapping to quaternions Re(b) = Re(w), Im(b) =
Im(w)*Im(a)/abs(Im(a)). Note that AMQuat has no quaternionic power function
a^b, if b=x is a real number, a^x is defined as exp(x*ln(a)).
