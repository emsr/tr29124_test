0. [] Use <filesystem> dammit!
      I'll wait until it shows up in std in libstdc++.

1. [] In mathar it turns out that
      (2\pi)^k B_{2k}/(2k)! - 2 is small.  It might be worth computing... carefully.
      I think I just did this in __riemann_zeta_m_1_sum.
      I might want a starting fit for small s?

2. [] __riemann_zeta_alt should be tested with vanWijnGaarden

3. [] Debye integrals matharr has some.  Started a test.

4. [] test asymptotic Hermite polys - adjust the crossover width!
GSL extras has these - there was struggle there too.

5. [] I got derivs in the Bessel asymp!
   Now I need a more principled max iteration.

6. [DONE] bincoeff can take real upper thing - infinitely many k
   Think (1 + x)^{1/2}.

7. [] Thrash long double testing!

8. [] Thrash float testing!

9. [DONE] ibeta complement

10. [] legendre_Qlm

11. [] Test against spherical_harmonic(unsigned n, int m, T1 theta, T2 phi);
    They have spherical_harmonic_[r|i]
    Note the signed m on all of them!

12. [DONE] Owen's T function (a stat function)
    template <class T>
      calculated-result-type owens_t(T h, T a);

13. [DONE] heuman_lambda - I've got this! - __heuman_lambda(_Tp __beta, _Tp __k)
    template <class T1, class T2>
      calculated-result-type heuman_lambda(T1 k, T2 phi);
    and __jacobi_zeta(_Tp __k, _Tp __phi)
    template <class T1, class T2, class Policy>
      calculated-result-type jacobi_zeta(T1 k, T2 phi, const Policy&);
    Done - __ellint_d(_Tp __k, _Tp __phi)
    template <class T1, class T2>
      calculated-result-type ellint_d(T1 k, T2 phi);

14. [DONE] Expose Bernoulli numbers.

15. [DONE] polygamma...

16. [] inverse erf and erfc.

17. [] inverse incomplete gammas
    [] We will want lgamma_scaled - the Binet function.
    [] Then tgamma_scaled - sometines called \Gamma^{*}.
    [] Then Amparo, Gil, etc have a paper...

18. [] In testcase.tcc in the big string_view header I'd like to be able to replace
       #include <specfun_testcase.h>
       with
       #include "../testcase.h"
       for TR1 test generation...

19. [DONE] Tabulate riemann_zeta for integer arguments - various sums can use this.

20. [DONE] Look at test_cyl_hankel - we got issues! vu=1, z=0.01 Y bombs on steeds algorithm!
       OK! Steeds algorithm fails for cyl_neumann for exatly nu=1 and no thoer. WTF!
       nearbyint(nu + .5) -> nearbyint(nu).  mu = nu - n was -1.

21. [] Finish experfc = exp(x*x)*erfc(x) (and maybe even sqrt(pi)*x*exp(x*x)*erfc(x))
       Callit erfc_scaled?

22. [] ../LambertW has a very good static polynomial I think - with static Horner.
       They use macros... Sigh.  Still, we could hack these into templates.

23. [DONE] We have both psi *and* digamma!  Pick one!

24. [DONE] polynomial.h needs outline polynomial.tcc

25. [] Why did dilog lose the x=0 test?
       It is because the answer dilog(0) == 0.  So the fractional error blows up even when the answer is spot on.
       But it doesn't look like such a point would be skipped though.
       We need a way of trapping this...
       We need a way of deciding when a point approximately crosses the real axis.
       We *don't* want to trap when points asymptotically approach the axis.
       So we need to store some previous numbers for a derivative approximation.
       Maybe if |f| < eps and |f - fprev| > N eps switch to absolute diff (and mark it).

26. [DONE] __log_gamma was a very sobering exercise in trig accuracy.
       The error in the location of the zeros of, say,
       std::sin(x) grow linearly with argument!
       I had to test epsilon * |x| for zero to place poles!
       The world really needs reperiodized trig functions!

27. [DONE] Should I do the /_GLIBCXX_END_NAMESPACE_VERSION thing for __gnu_cxx?
           Yes!

28. [DONE] ibeta looks like it might have problems for large a, b near end points.
           Check test_beta_inc.

29. [DONE] Lose __eps, __min, __max, __inf, __NaN from math_const in favor of numeric_limits.h

30. [DONE] Why did check_lfactorial.cc get chopped after 171?
	 { 711.71472580228999, 171, 0.0 },
      -  { 716.86222027910344, 172, 0.0 },

      After the table stops at 180 __log_gamma is called.
      +// Divergence at n=172 f=inf f_GSL=716.86222027910344
      +// Divergence at n=173 f=inf f_GSL=722.01551187360121

      +//  ...
      +// Divergence at n=500 f=inf f_GSL=2611.3304584601556

31. [] I seem to have lost accuracy in cyl_bessel_i near the origin.
       cyl_neumann also for < 2!  All bessels in non-oscillatory region.

32. [] radpoly is nan ing out for odd m!

33. [DONE] beta for a=100 b>71 wrong sign.  But dead on magnitude!  We could crush it!

34. [] In test_riemann_zeta the negative argument differences between real zetac an zeta are much worse.
       Reflection formula and reperiodized stuff?

35. [DONE] expint_en may be just sloppy.  I think recursion may be bad?
       Boost uses CF + series.

36. [] Gather 32-digit spot checks from:
       http://functions.wolfram.com/webMathematica/FunctionEvaluation.jsp

37. [DONE] Things involving say std::cyl_bessel(__float128, __float128) won't compile.
       We have __float128 in the promote thing.
       Somehow, the promote thing is broken.
       These were using the old school promote!

38. [] Look at the results of test_bessel, test_sph_bessel, near the originas a function of.
       You have to widen the near zero. Look at the near zero asymptotics and come up with a thing
       as a function of underflow exponent and nu.
       Neumann and K are just going to blow.
       Should I go ahead and let J, I return denormal results?  Why not.
       And if the type doesn't do denorm just zero then and don't sweat.

40. [DONE] sph_neumann is broken.

41. [DONE] Add a state for Fock-airy functions and use it.

42. [] We might not even need numeric_limits_float128.h - the generic ones might work.

43. [DONE] test_polylog has some remaining float128 issues.
    Building and execution work but there are other general issues.

44. [DONE] test_hankel build fails on  
       test_hankel.cpp:52:47: error: no matching function for call to '__airy(std::complex<double>&, double)'
          auto Airy = std::__detail::__airy(z, 1.0e-16);
       It builds.
       It's probably an API change.

45. [] test_factorial build.

46. [] Have a look at
         src/c++98/math_stubs_float.cc
         src/c++98/math_stubs_long_double.cc
       for guidance on how we might help add float128.

47. [] test_hankel crashes.
         what():  __hankel_uniform_sum: all allowable terms used

48. [] It would be a good idea to generate check_nan.cc and compile.cc with all combinations automatically.

49. [] If numeratorial parameters in hypers are nonpositive integers,
       * The sums are finite polynomials
       * Which can be summed by Horners rule

50. [] We can do error analysis (sigfigs, etc) by computing functions with several 
       This can be set up.  This is what test *really* should be.  We can publish that.
       I would say *that* is your error anaysis.
51. [] Look for places where you can calculate max_iter and do it.

52. [] What the hell happened to diff_sph_harmonic.txt?
       No type suffix.
       The numbers only have one or two digits.

53. [] Have default tail function types - provide _ZeroTail and maybe _InfTail.
       These could be tag types and we if constexpr tail calls right out. _NoTail?

54. [] test_special_function - it's the std functions that cause build failure.
       The GSL functions a re just fine.

55. [] Make 2D color plots of the Hurwitz zeta function (complex)
       Wikipedia has cool color pictures.
         As a function of q for s = 3+4i;
           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_zeta_function#/media/File:HurwitzofAz3p4j.png
         As a function of s for q = 24/25;
           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurwitz_zeta_function#/media/File:Hurwitza24ov25v2.png

56. [] For complex128 IO it would be nice to figure out:
       * extern template
       * wide character streams.

57. [] Make work: test_inv_ibeta.cpp
       Fix ext/roots

58. [DONE] Make work: test_kelvin.cpp
       Functions __psi, __factorial, etc.
       __gnu_cxx::__fpinteger

       I needed three internal headers even though I had C++17 and cmath and -I.

59. [] What to do with test_bessel_asymp.cpp?
       It could be junk.  Or not.
       Fix it UP!
       Should the complex std::__detail::__cyl_bessel(nu, x) in sf_hankel.tcc
	 be renamed to the real std::__detail::__cyl_bessel_jn(nu, x)?
	 Also: __cyl_bessel_jn_asymp_old should be upgraded with derivatives!
	 OTOH: I think I've adopted this.

60. [] Make work: test_bessel_iter.cpp
       Complete it.  Make those polynomials up!

61. [DONE] __float128 pow barfage in several things.
       There's a stack overflow in the pow call.
       It actually looks suspect.
       cmath:418

       Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
       0x00000000004158d2 in std::pow<__float128, __float128> (__x=0, __y=0) at ./cmath:418
       418	      return pow(__type(__x), __type(__y));

       Idea: the promote is messed up with float128 again.

       That may be part of the problem but we have a __builtin_pow.
       So I used it and shit worked!
       That also follows the pattern in the rest of the cmath header!

62. [DONE] Make work: test_little_airy.cpp

67. [] Make work: test_factorial.cpp
       All sorts of include and undeclared fuckery.
       Look like an include cycle or something.  Everything is broken.

68. [] Look at: test_dawson.cpp
       It works but we have todos on the compile-time construction of arrays.

69. [DONE] Make work: test_complex128.cpp
     test_complex128.cpp - No compile.
     1. No powi - commented out but should we have it?
	I commented these out.
     2. No cxxxq() funs.  Do we want these in global ns (as they are called in the test)?
	Blocked with HAVE_C99_COMPLEX128 just in case.
	They are in <complex> in C namespace.  They are used for overloads.

70. [] Look at: test_carlson.cpp
       Compile shit.
       But maybe we're past needing this thing.

71. [] test_kelvin.cpp

72. [DONE] Look at test_airy.cpp
   test_airy.cpp - compiles and runs but the numbers are wierd but the tests maybe bogus anyway.
     Maybe repurpose this.
     Lots of unused variables.  Fixed.

     Rename to debug_airy.cpp

73. [DONE] Modernize hankel_transition.cpp
     hankel_transition.cpp - Update structs.

74. [] Complex literal arithmetic.
    complex_literal_arith.cpp - C99 vs C++ literals.
    complex_literal_arith.cpp - The operators again.  Fsck!
    complex.cpp - The operators again.  Fsck!

75. [DONE] Fix up test_struve_old.cpp and those hyperg_pFq.cpp.
	   test_struve_old.cpp - Goes with those hyperg_pFq.cpp.  Try to fix it up.
	   hyperg_1F2.cpp - undef variable 'stop'
	   hyperg_2F0.cpp - undef variable 'stop'
	   hyperg_3F0.cpp - undef variable 'stop'
    These were from cephes.

76. [] Get test_hypot.cpp into mainline and kill it here.
    I put my version in
      /home/ed/gcc/libstdc++-v3/include/c_global/cmath
    I'll need to enhance
      /home/ed/gcc/libstdc++-v3/testsuite/26_numerics/headers/cmath/hypot.cc
    I think I have it at work too.

77. [] Restore C++11 compatibity. Sigh.
    No xxx_t traits (C++14).
    No complex_literals
    No std::exchange.
    Couldn't handle two NSDMIs and number of args.  Bug?


carlson_std.cpp - Collisions all over.  no surprise there.

78. [] Make hankel_toy_new compile.
hankel_toy_new.cpp - Undefinedreference constant things in some struct.

79. [] Possible library DR.
    Several domain errors seem rather unnecessary:
    legendre: |x| > 1
    assoc_legendre: |x| > 1
    laguerre: x < 0
    assoc_laguerre: x < 0

    Note this difference in the documentation.

80. [] Test, fix, and ship gamma_reciprocal!
    Something's broken.
    Also, there might be other useful forms besides the series.
    I think we're about done.
    i wanted to try mpreal to get good coefficients.
    Broke mpreal tring to get it to play with float128.
    Maybe I have to let go of Q numbers in testers and stay standard.
    I could use 'auto del = _Tp{1} / _Tp{10};' everywhere.

81. [DONE] polylog is broken for polylog_exp(real, cmplx) for first argument s=2.6.
       This impacts the derived functions bose_einstein and fermi_dirac.
       vimdiff test_polylog.txt zeta/zeta.txt
       FIXED?

82. [DONE] test_anger_weber.cpp Get integer orders working.

83. [] All that quadrature work and other stuff is in ~/tr2/ - holy shit!
       Check it out.  Merge the good stuff.

84. [] Put together basic math functions so we could build a cmath if we needed to for, say, decimal, or fixed.

85. [DONE] Finish the Stirling numbers in test_bernoulli.cpp
       This also has bernoulli and Euler polynomials and numbers.
       I'm thinking of peeling off a sf_bernoulli.tcc
       It would be a good idea o get generalized bernoulli polys for other functions that could use them.

86. [] Play with Bernoulli and euler polynomials computed via Fourier transforms.
       They might be fast too.
       They generalize to noninteger order.

87. [DONE] Figure out maxint (test_maxint.cpp) and deliver it with numeric_limits.h
       ldexp(1, std::numeric_limits<Tp>::digits);
       calling it __max_integer.

88. [] I think __parity(int __k) {return __k & 1 ? -1 : +1; }
       possibly with some optional casting to floats would be real nice.

89. [] cephes has a mod2pi. Figure out WTF it actually does.
       Make it type generic.
       See if you can use it in concert with *_pi circular functions.
       The guts of a good fmod might also hold clues.

90. [] Put a more extensive deathmatch test (in a separate function) in the corresponding test_*.cpp
       Work out kinks!

91. [DONE] I had to add a declaration for __float128 pow to cmath to prevent infinite recursion
       in cmath (near line 418).  I think everything that uses __gnu_cxx::__promote_2
       (which doesn't know about __float128) will fail on this score.
       Either I should
	* fold in definitions __float128 into cmath,
	* pre-declare __float128 stuff in cmath (what i did with one functions),
	* or teach __promote_2 about __float128.
        * SEE ITEM 61!!!

92. [] Steal root finding tests from GSL.

93. [] Gamma uses gamma_reciprocal_series!  Not Lanczos or Spouge!

94. [] Finish Mittag-Leffler
       Now test_mittag_leffler.cpp plots look really good against that paper.
       Nailed it!!!
       Also get the Wright functions.
       Line up deathmatch tests.
       Equator should have tests for M-L at least for real arg.

95. [] polyloghas tests where some of the variables don't actually change.
       Look for ???
       Maybe change tests in both places and see if we can agre with good numbers.

96. [] Lose the Tp{0.123Q} decimals in favor of Tp fractions!
       Make damn sure this doesn't get into specfun impls!
       This will make mpreal integration easier too.

97. [] The plots for Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein look choppy.
       I need to jump in and work on polylog.

98. [DONE] test_gamma_recip - the thing that makes the coefficients should stop
       when the last coeff is smaller than epsilon.
       Size:
       float       : 17
       double      : 27
       long double : 31
       __float128  : 46
     We could make a variable template and not check in the series.

99. [] test_gamma_recip - The negative arg vales are completely hosed for __float128.
	They alternate between long doublish vales (probably due to factorial)
        and -2ish!!!  The 2-deltas are the usual wrong sign! Probably the sin_pi!

100. [] Check out
        Lazhar Fekih-Ahmed - "On the Power Series Expansion of the Reciprocal Gamma Function"
        Probably not useful but... you never know.

101. [] 3D plots need to have the surface occlude the 2D thing.
        Also, te colors need work.

102. [] Crazy Idea: invent a stream option for formatting individual scalar numbers inside
        a complex or a vector.  width, justification, (do we need scientific, etc?)

103. [] The negative int polylog exp fails for s = 0.  Differs by 0.5.

104. [] The negative int polylog exp fails for z = -1.
        We could use the plynomial even if it's not stable generally?
        I think what's happening is that the routines use reflection for negative argument.
        There is generally a pole at x = 1.

105. [] The negative even int polylog exp fails for -1 < z < -small.

106. [] Semantic constants.  pi() that would do lazy math and figure out a precision.

107. [] I wonder if measure theory, and a measure for computer numbers would help
        with understanding the relationship between computer math and real number math.

108. [] Look into folding polylog cases:
            __polylog_exp_pos(unsigned int __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_pos(unsigned int __s, _Tp __w)
            __polylog_exp_pos(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_neg(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_neg(int __n, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_int_pos(unsigned int __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_int_pos(unsigned int __s, _Tp __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_int_neg(int __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_int_neg(int __s, _Tp __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_real_pos(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_real_pos(_Tp __s, _Tp __w)
        and
            __polylog_exp_real_neg(_Tp __s, std::complex<_Tp> __w)
            __polylog_exp_real_neg(_Tp __s, _Tp __w)

109. [] Learn how to plot even in log space and use it to pick up details in polylog
        near the origin.
        Maybe a plot_utils.h would be nice.

110. [] If 2^{-s} < epsilon, zeta == 1.
        For zetam1 you should keep trying - that's why we have it.
        The polylog_asymp is slow.
